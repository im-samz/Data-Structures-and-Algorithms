# Project Description
The project was to create a simple Pac-Man game with a single ghost chasing after the player. 

## Learning Purpose
Students were tasked to program collision detection of the graphical figures. This included implementing a collision detection algorithm and a Binary Search Tree that stores all the pixels of a given graphical figure. All major methods of a BST were used to check if each pixel of a figure was intersecting with another.

## Student Contribution
Students were to implement the following classes: **Location, Pixel, BinarySearchTree, BinaryNode, GraphicalFigure, DuplicatedKeyException, InexistentKeyException, and EmptyTreeException**. The remaining classes were provided by the instructor.

### How to Run
To run, place all image and text files outside of the src directory containing the java files. The text files will be parsed to set the structure of the game-field. The main method is found in Show.java, and the program can be executed by typing the following in the command window:

  **java Show *input_txt_file* **

You may need to expand the output window to view the menu controls.
