# Project Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a Java program that plays (n, k)-tic-tac-toe, where n is the size of the n x n board and k is the number of adjacent symbols needed to win.

## Learning Purpose
Students were tasked to program an algorithm for the computer to decide which tile to play in order to maximize its chances of winning. This was done by utilizing a **HashMap** to store all game states and the likelihood of winning if that move is played.

# Student Contribution
Classes implemented include Record.java, Dictionary.java, and nk_TicTacToe.java. All other classes were provided by the instructor.

## How to Run
To run, place image files into the same directory as the java files. Play_nk_TTT.java contains the main method, so the program can be executed by typing
  **java Play_nk_TTT.java n k max_levels**
