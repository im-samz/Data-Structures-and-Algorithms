The purpose of this assignment is to create a Java program that plays (n, k)-tic-tac-toe, where n is the size of the nxn board and k is the number of adjacent symbols needed to win.

Students were tasked to program an algorithm for the computer to decide which tile to play in order to maximize its chances of winning. This was done by utilizing a HashMap to store all game states and the likelihood of winning if that move was played.

Classes implemented include Record.java, Dictionary.java, and nk_TicTacToe.java. All other classes were provided by the instructor.

To run, place image files into the same directory as the java files. Play_nk_TTT.java contains the main method, so the program can be executed by typing
  java Play_nk_TTT.java n k max_levels
